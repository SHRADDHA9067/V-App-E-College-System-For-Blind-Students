# V-App-E-College-System-For-Blind-Students
In these project we developed the app for visually blind students

Objective:
This app helps blind students access important college information like timetables, fee reminders, and events using audio. Teachers can manage the system by adding and updating these details.

Technologies Used:
Languages: Kotlin and Java
Text-to-Speech: Converts text into audio so students can listen to information.
Features:
Teacher Features:
Add Timetables: Teachers can add and update class schedules.
Fee Reminders: Teachers can set fee payment reminders.
Add Events: Teachers can add events (exams, workshops) and updates.
Full Control: Teachers can manage all the information in the app.
Student Features:
Text-to-Speech: The app reads out timetables, fees, and events in audio format.
Easy Navigation: Students can navigate the app using voice commands.
Challenges and Solutions:
Accessibility: Ensured the app works well with screen readers for blind students.
Voice Recognition: Improved voice command accuracy to make the app easy to use.
Impact:
The app helps blind students manage their academic life independently by reading important information aloud. It also gives teachers easy control over managing content.

Future Improvements:
Navigation: Add GPS-based help for students to find classrooms.
Offline Access: Make the app work without internet.
More Integrations: Connect the app with other learning tools.
